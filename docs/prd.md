### 1. Introduction & Document Purpose

**Purpose:** This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the InkWell Platform's backend system. It is the authoritative source of truth for the engineering, QA, and product teams to guide development, testing, and deployment.

**Product Vision:** InkWell is a modern, cloud-native platform designed to provide writers with a simple, reliable, and high-performance environment for publishing and managing their content. It solves the problem of technical friction for creators by offering a backend system that is fundamentally secure, scalable, and resilient, allowing writers to focus solely on their craft.

### 2. Project Goals & Objectives

The project is driven by the following strategic goals, which translate into concrete technical objectives:

*   **GOAL-1: Provide a Seamless and Reliable Publishing Platform:**
    *   **Objective:** Deliver a robust set of tools for content and media management that "just works."
*   **GOAL-2: Engineer an Exceptional User Experience:**
    *   **Objective:** Achieve high availability (99.9%), low latency on all user-facing interactions, and architectural fault tolerance.
*   **GOAL-3: Build a Scalable Foundation for Future Growth:**
    *   **Objective:** Implement a decoupled, service-oriented architecture that allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of features.
*   **GOAL-4: Achieve Operational Excellence and Security:**
    *   **Objective:** Build a system that is secure by design, fully observable (metrics, logs, traces), and leverages infrastructure-as-code and automation.

### 3. Target Personas

*   **The Writer (Primary User):** An individual who creates, edits, and manages posts containing text and media. They require a fast, intuitive, and reliable experience.
*   **The Platform Operator (Internal User):** An engineer (SRE, DevOps) responsible for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the system. They require comprehensive observability, clear service boundaries, and robust security controls.

### 4. Functional Requirements (FRs)

*   **FR-01: Secure User Account Management**
    *   FR-01.1: Users must be able to register for a new account using an email and password.
    *   FR-01.2: Users must be able to log in to receive a secure, short-lived session token (e.g., JWT).
    *   FR-01.3: Authenticated users must be able to manage their profile and log out, which must invalidate the active session.
*   **FR-02: Content Management (Posts)**
    *   FR-02.1: Authenticated users must be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own posts.
    *   FR-02.2: A post must have a state, at minimum `DRAFT` and `PUBLISHED`.
    *   FR-02.3: A post consists of a title, a body of text, and a list of associated media asset URLs.
*   **FR-03: Scalable Media Management**
    *   FR-03.1: To upload a media file, the client must first request a secure, time-limited, pre-signed upload URL from the API.
    *   FR-03.2: The client must be able to use this URL to upload the file directly to the platform's object storage.
    *   FR-03.3: The system must associate the final media URL with the user's post.
*   **FR-04: Asynchronous Post-Creation Processing**
    *   FR-04.1: When a user creates a post, the API must perform only the essential validation and database insertion, then return an immediate success response.
    *   FR-04.2: Long-running tasks such as thumbnail generation, content indexing for search, or spam analysis must be triggered to run asynchronously in the background.
*   **FR-05: Event-Driven Notifications**
    *   FR-05.1: When a post's state changes to `PUBLISHED`, the system must publish a `PostPublished` event onto a central event bus.
    *   FR-05.2: A dedicated notification service must consume this event and handle the business logic for sending notifications, ensuring this process is fully decoupled from the core post-creation flow.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*   **Performance & Latency**
    *   **NFR-01 (API Latency):** All synchronous, user-facing API endpoints **must** respond in **under 500ms at the 95th percentile (p95)**.
    *   **NFR-02 (Cache Latency):** Reads for cached content (e.g., popular posts) **must** respond in **under 100ms at p95**.
    *   **NFR-03 (Upload Decoupling):** Media uploads **must not** consume CPU, memory, or network bandwidth on the application servers. The workload must be offloaded to the object storage service.
*   **Scalability & Elasticity**
    *   **NFR-04 (Independent Scaling):** All services (User, Post, Worker, Notification) **must** be independently deployable and scalable to handle varying loads.
    *   **NFR-05 (Job Queue Scalability):** The background processing system **must** be able to handle a 10x spike in job submissions over a 5-minute period without impacting user-facing API performance.
*   **Availability & Reliability**
    *   **NFR-06 (System Uptime):** The platform **must** achieve **99.9% uptime**, calculated monthly. This requires a multi-AZ deployment for all critical components, including the primary database.
    *   **NFR-07 (Fault Tolerance):** Failure of a downstream, asynchronous consumer (e.g., Notifications) **MUST NOT** impact the availability of the core synchronous API (e.g., creating a post).
*   **Security**
    *   **NFR-08 (Secure Perimeter):** All application services **must** reside in private subnets and be inaccessible from the public internet. All traffic **must** be routed through a managed API Gateway.
    *   **NFR-09 (Secret Management):** All secrets (passwords, API keys) **must** be stored in and fetched at runtime from a centralized secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager). Automated secret rotation should be enabled.
    *   **NFR-10 (Least Privilege):** Service-to-service communication and database access **must** be governed by IAM roles that grant the minimum permissions required for operation.
    *   **NFR-11 (Data Encryption):** All data **must** be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (using managed encryption on all data stores like RDS, S3, and ElastiCache).
*   **Maintainability & Operability**
    *   **NFR-12 (Comprehensive Observability):** The system **must** provide centralized logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing for all services. A trace ID generated at the gateway **must** be propagated through all subsequent service calls, events, and jobs.
    *   **NFR-13 (Externalized Configuration):** All configuration (e.g., resource names, feature flags) **must** be supplied to services via environment variables, adhering to 12-Factor App principles.
    *   **NFR-14 (Clear Ownership):** The system **must** be organized into services with clear, documented domain boundaries and ownership.
